# Music Organiser
I have a self-hosted [Navidrome](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome) server and a music collection that is ever-increasing 
in size. Managing my music collection is becoming increasingly time-consuming and 
difficult. Organising folder structure, tags, covers, replay gains, and re-encoding,
is a very long process.

The purpose of this program is to help streamline my music organising process and help
keep track of my music collection. Doing this through automated processes such as 
making folder structure, uploading to my music server, and everything inbetween the
two, while also having an interface to manually set tracking variables and highlight
issues. 


### ðŸš§THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESSðŸš§

Currently, this program is tailored specifically to my use-case. The UI sucks, and most
of these features I talk about are missing. At this current moment in time I can add,
remove, and edit Artists and Albums. 

This program is still in it's very early stages, all the code I have written to add,
edit, and remove, Artists and Albums will go through a large re-write, to refine the
codebase, making cleaner, simpler, more modular and more maintainable code.
